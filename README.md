## Spoilers first
This project had it's alpha release being made by our seniors.<br>
NodeJS has been used to make this product.<br>
## What has been done
The site has the facility to store the details of students, books and the transactions.<br>

There are two separate folders for the front and back end. These folders contain the readme files on how to use them. Hope you understand them.<br>
## What has to be done
The site has to support the following changes.<br>
Do note that the following are for long terms also.<br>
* Support for student to track each book he has given.
* Android and iOS app.
* Website compatibility.
## How to contribute
Users can follow what the project leader says. But the usual way is that the issues can be taken up anyone. Just a comment under the issue or the Slack group would help.<br>
<b>Have a great day :)</b>
